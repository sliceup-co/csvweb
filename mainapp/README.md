CHEP

CHEP (Clustering of HElical Polymers) is a python  program for the clustering of 2D helical polymers into homogeneous groups by using the results of 2D classification and information about the association of segments to the helical polymers. It is developed in the group of Gunnar Schröder at the Forschungszentrum Jülich.

The k-means clustering and elbow tests are implemented using Sklearn modules. The results of this algorithm will be published soon.


usage: for example


python chep.py --infile relion_2dclassification.star --cluster_num 4
